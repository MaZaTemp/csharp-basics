You might have to authorize GitHub Classroom to make changes to your repositories in order to allow the platform to create repositories for assignments for you etc.:\

# Your Repository

You will find your repository now.\
Notice the name, which is `forsbergsskola-se/[yourcoursename]-yy-mmdd-[assignment-name]-[your-user-name]`\
Usually, all important information for the assignment can be found in the repository's README:\
<img width="1140" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/134996462-1d811751-54eb-41de-abd6-19e8c4ba53ce.png">

You can Clone (Download) your repository to your computer now, by clicking Code...\
<img width="97" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/134996657-724bf1cf-b70f-477c-8e73-de798b9735c1.png">
And then Open with GitHub Desktop\
<img width="245" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/134996682-c8d5b76b-55b4-4c59-b564-5f7b9873b329.png">

In the Popup, make sure that your repository gets cloned somewhere, where you want it.\
Recommendation Windows: `C:\Projects\`\
Recommendation Mac: `~/Projects/`\
<img width="506" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/134996902-6c4885d4-bc7e-4e3f-9fe7-e17766fb843a.png">

Now, the repository has been downloaded to your computer.\
<img width="744" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/134996980-23b58ae3-a8fd-459d-9893-f742418bd938.png">

And you can start using GitHub Desktop to commit and push all your changes to the repository, just as you're already used to :)\
<img width="965" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/134997154-19907f1a-5816-467d-8426-cbb55f755834.png">

Often, I will include a link to the original (my) repository in the README.\
This is, because your repositories won't update anymore, if I add, fix or improve the slides or exercise descriptions.\
In order to get the most up-to-date-slides, please follow the link in the top of the repository:\
<img width="745" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/134996617-54cc504a-7fec-4cec-9959-a3fc565971f6.png">

Make sure, to not clone this repository, though ðŸ¤¡\
It will show a Code and a Use this Template Button\
But these buttons won't really help you, since this is my personal repository\
Notice, how the repository name starts with `marczaku/`\
<img width="1118" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/134997227-92791a5a-eaa0-4ef9-b7a6-2024b5e96034.png">

# What do to? What to commit?

You should find detailed instructions on what projects to create and / or what code to write within the repository.\
Again: Make sure to check the most up-to-date slides / exercises by following the link on the top of the README :)\
Just make sure to add all files and projects to your Assignment Repository (named `gp21-21-0927-csharp-basics-nim-[yourusername]` or similar)

# Handing In the Assignment

You can keep track of the assignment's Hand-In Date on Google Classroom:\
<img width="596" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/134997455-21e5665a-1f38-491a-825d-4814ec079c49.png">

Before the Assignment's Due Date is over, make sure to click on View Assignment...\
<img width="137" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/134997505-4197f936-0124-4931-b4d2-f5d8c60ead13.png">

And then pick Mark as Done\
<img width="244" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/134997535-278568ec-915c-4cc0-8e6c-119debd82958.png">

If you're fancy, you may add a link to your GitHub Repository first:\
<img width="227" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/134997571-3046d8da-ed03-4531-905c-f9e3e869e7d7.png">

If not, you can also confirm the Hand-In to be empty. (I will find the Hand-In on GitHub Classroom anyways)\
<img width="240" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/134997621-0e67f246-8b78-4992-828f-ec9db10e74b8.png">


And that's it! :)
Just make sure that your code is committed and pushed before you Hand-In.

# Late Hand-Ins
Late Hand-Ins usually get graded with a maximum possible score of `Barely Passed (D)`\
If you have a good excuse for your hand-in (a doctor's notice, for example) contact me, in order to avoid receiving a bad grade.
If you have failed the assignment, or just forgotten to hand it in, you may still hand it in (again) to receive a `Barely Passed (D)` still, in second try.
