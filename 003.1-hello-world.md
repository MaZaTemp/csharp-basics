## 1. First Things First - Install DotNet

- Open https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
- Download and Install .NET 5.0

## 2. Create a Project

- **The cleanest way:** Use Microsoft‘s dotnet console command
  - First, use cd path/to/directory to move to the desired folder
  - You can use **pwd** to check in what directory you are right now
  - Then, use dotnet new console `–o HelloWorld` to create a new C# console project

## 3. Project Directory

- `HelloWorld.csproj` – This is our C#-Project file *(short: csproj)*
- `Program.cs` – This is our only C#-Script for this Project
- `obj` – This is a temporary directory used by the compiler while building *(short for object)*
- `bin` – This is where our Binary is built to *(short for binary)*

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/134818821-f85d79b8-bb69-43f8-92a2-b0d5fa5f1d53.png" width="400" height="300">

---

## 4. CSPROJ

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  
</Project>
```

- XML-Format
- Contains a Project using `Microsoft.Net`
- The Output-Type is an *Executable*
  - This is a program that can be executed on its own
- Target Framework is `netcoreapp3.1`
  - It is thee most current framework right now

---

## 5. Program.cs

```cs

using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
    }
    
  }
  
}
```

- 13 Lines of Code for Some Console Output.
- Let‘s go through this Line by Line:
- **What‘s that?**

```cs

using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
```

---

## 6. Namespaces

#### What is a Namespace?

<sub>This is one framwork</sub>
```cs
public class Job {
  public string name;
  public object handle;
}
```

<sub>This is another framework</sub>
```cs
public class Job {
  public int id;
  public object handle;
  
}
```
- **Imagine this:**
  - You are using two Frameworks in your project. They both contain a class named `Job`.
  - How do you address each class now?
  - They have the same name...
  - *Hint: It often won‘t even compile.*

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7360266/134821346-0e83f055-fbca-4b0f-b0be-e7459d0716c0.png" width="400" height="100">

---

## 7. Solution

```cs
namespace ECS {
  public class Job {
    public string name;
    public object handle;
  }
}  
```

<sub>This is another framework</sub>
```cs
namespace OOP { 
  public class Job {
    public int id;
    public object handle;
  }
}
```
#### Solution: Namespaces.
- If they both have their own namespace, everything will work just fine.

---

## 8. Namespaces 2

```cs
public static void Main() {
  var job = new OOP.Job();
}
```
```cs
using OOP;
public class Program {
  public static void Main() {
    var job = new Job();
  }
}
```
```cs
using Job = OOP.Job;
public class Program {
  public static void Main() {
    var job = new Job();
  }
}
```

- **How to use these classes now?**
- Either fully address them
  - Or Add a using Statement to the beginning of your file *(this will allow you to use ALL classes
 within that namespace without addressing them)*
  - Or add a specific using Statement to the beginning of your file

---

## 9. Namespaces 3

```cs
namespace ECS {
  namespace Jobs {
    public class Job {...}
  }
  namespace Math {
    public class Vector {...}
  }
}
```
```cs
namespace ECS.Jobs {
  public class Job {
    public string name;
    public object handle;
  }
}
```
```cs
using ECS.Jobs;
```

- **Nesting namespaces:**
- You can, and should, nest your namespaces
- **Rule of thumb:**
  - Every Folder in your project should have ist own namespace
  - Its namespace should be nested in the parent folder‘s namespace

---

## 10. Curly Braces

```cs
namespace HelloWorld
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
    }
  }
}
```

- Curly Braces always define a scope. 
- **They are used for:**
  - Namespaces
  - Classes
  - Methods
  - Loops
  - … and many more!
- Every opening bracket needs a closing bracket
- Everything inbetween is part of the scope

---

## 11. Program.cs 2

```cs
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
  ```
  
- So, what‘s happening here, then?
- We‘re using `.Net`‘s System Namespace, that contains tons of useful classes, including the Console-class.
- Then, we‘re creating our own namespace, like every good software should do ☺

---

## 12. Program.cs 3

```cs
class Program
{
  ```
  
- Next, a Class called *Program* is defined.
- It is **not** required to have a Class named Program.
- It has only become a standard to call the Main-Class Program.
- The class could have any name, though!

---

## 13. OOP

```cs
void OpenHouseDoor(int houseId) {}
void CloseHouseDoor(int houseId) {}
int GetNeighbourHouse(int houseId) {}
void CreateHouse(int houseId) {}

void main()  {
  CreateHouse(1);
  OpenHouseDoor(1);
  OpenHouseDoor(GetNeighbourHouse(1));
}
```
```cs
class House {
  public void OpenDoor(){}
    public void CloseDoor(){}
  public House GetNeighbour(){}
}

void Main() {
  var house = new House();
  house.OpenDoor();
  house.CloseDoor();
  house.GetNeighbour().OpenDoor();
}
```

- `C#` is an object-oriented language
- Procedural programming languages, like C, build the whole application defining and calling functions
- In Object-Oriented languages, you design your code using objects.
- Instead of having an `OpenHouseDoor`-Method, you would have a `House`-Object with an `OpenDoor`-Method.

---

## 14. Classes & Objects

```cs
class Fruit {}
class Car {}

static void Main() {
  var apple = new Fruit();
  var banana = new Fruit();
  var mango = new Fruit();
  var volvo = new Car();
  var audi = new Car();
}
```

- Classes are types. Templates for Objects.
- Objects are instances of those classes.
- Objects inherit all code that the class provides.
- So, if a Car-Class has a `Drive()`-Method
- Then both `volvo.Drive()` and `audi.Drive()`
- Are valid function calls

---

## 15. Classes & Objects 2

```cs
//Beginning of class definition
class car {
  
//This is where the contents of the class belong
}
//End of the class definition
```

- You define a class by using the Keyword class 
- Followed by the name of the class
- Followed by Curly Braces {
- Followed by the contents of you class
- Followed by Curly Braces }

---

## 16. Program.cs 4

```cs
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
     
 ```
      
- Next, a static method called `Main` is defined.
- It has one parameter named args of type `string[]`
- A static method called `Main`, with this Parameter, will be the entry point of your application. 
- The return type may be int (Exit Code), or Task, or Task<Int> (Async).
- The parameter `string[] args` can be omitted.

---

## 17. Program.cs 5

```cs
  
  Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
  
```
  ```cs
  public static void WriteLine(string value)
  ```
  
- Console-Class‘s WriteLine-Method is called.
- The local string-value `Hello World!` is defined and passed as value-Argument.
- `WriteLine` is a static method, therefor, it can be accessed directly through the class.


---

## 18. Is'nt that amount of code a little too much?
  
#### It sure is!

- First, we‘re not using the Arguments from the Main-Method
- So we can just as well leave them out

```cs
  using System;
  
  namespace HelloWorld
  {
     class Program
      {
         static void Main()
           {
             Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
           }
       }
   }
 ```
  <br></br>
  
- Next, we don‘t need a Namespace for our Program-Class
- Since there is no other Program-Class in the ::global Namespace
  
```cs
    using System;
     class Program
      {
         static void Main()
           {
             Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
           }
      }
  ```
  
  <br></br>
  
  - Since we are only using classes within the System-Namespace once, we can 
  instead of using the whole Namespace, just fully qualify the Console Class
  
  ```cs
   class Program
      {
         static void Main()
           {
             System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
           }
      }
  ```
 
 <br></br> 

- We can further shorten the syntax by using
- C#‘s expression body syntax
- Where instead of putting the method body between `{}`
- We can put one line of code behind `=>`

```cs
class Program
{
  static void Main() => System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
}
```

<br></br>

- **Actually…**
- Since `.NET 5`, we don‘t even need to specify a class with a Main Method anymore
- For simple programs, we can just write the code we want to execute 
- Outside of a class

```cs
System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```
---

## 19. Now, this is what I call a proper "Hello World!"

```cs
System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```
